\section{Virtual Hardware and Booting}

\begin{frame}{What is QEMU?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item An emulator that virtualizes the hardware (different from containers!)
    \item Sometimes used to run binaries for other architectures.
    \item We can test run kernels, firmware, etc.
    \item Drivers for virtual hardware are readily available and much simpler
      than real hardware.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is an initramfs?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item An archive that the kernel unpacks when first booting (usually in the
      form of a cpio file).
    \item MUST contain an executable script at \texttt{/init}
    \item This gives you the opportunity to mount filesystems and switch root to
      a filesystem on your disk (later lecture!).
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
